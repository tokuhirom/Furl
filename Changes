    commit 8a7786905c101eeab9db1d7baa8c4ec2076f9514
    Author: Jari Salmela <bissei@users.noreply.github.com>
    Date:   Fri Feb 6 08:36:55 2015 +0200

        Update HTTP.pm

        fix for keep-alive as zmmail proposed.
        "In line 526 of Furl/HTTP.pm, FURL checks the HTTP response headers it gets from the server. It will read the C
    onnection from the response header there, and compare the header value with the string keep-alive. The problem is t
    hat this does not take into account a different case of the response header. Some HTTP server returns a header valu
    e of Keep-Alive (mind the caps), so FURL does not recognize it properly.

        I think the following change to Furl/HTTP.pm is more robust.

        if ($connection_header eq 'keep-alive') {
        if (lc($connection_header) eq 'keep-alive') {"
